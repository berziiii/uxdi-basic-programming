# uxdi-basic-programming

This repository is for the User Experience Design Immersive program at General Assembly for their intro to HTML/CSS & Web Development trainings. 

The repo has two examples, one being a cookie recipe that the designers have to recreate and follow instructions and the second consists of an about and resume page for Betty White. For respect and copy write purposes, her name was changed to Wendy G. Bite. This example has 'final' PDF's that the designers have to turn into code. It is intended to recreate what they will be providing for future developer colleagues to code.
